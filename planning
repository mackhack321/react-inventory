Software stack:
    React frontend -> Python (Flask) backend -> MySQL database

Necessary database columns:
    - ID number (primary key, ex: 0001)
    - Item name (ex: "Dell monitor")
    - Deployment (ex: "Downstairs server" or "Not deployed")
    - Creation date (when the item was entered into the database)
    - Last updated date (the last time any column was changed)

Flask API endpoints:
    - /create:
        Description: create a new item in the database
        Request: entries for each database column
        Response: OK or error

    - /deploy:
        Description: update the deployment of an existing item
        Request: item ID, new deployment status
        Response: OK or error

    - /getall:
        Description: get entire database of items
        Request: none
        Response: entire database in .map-friendly JSON form

    - /remove:
        Description: remove item from database
        Request: item ID
        Response: OK or error

    - /update:
        Description: edits an item
        Request: item ID, new entry data
        Response: OK or error

    - /search (maybe, would be really cool):
        Description: searches for databse entries based off of a search term
        Request: search term
        Response: items that match (SELECT * FROM table WHERE name LIKE "%[search term]%")

Frontend features:
    - display database in table form
    - new item form with barcode scanner input for ID
    - change deployment status form
    - edit form (for editing all fields except for ID and creation date which cannot be changed)
    - delete button
    - sort alphabetically, by ID, by creation date, by last updated date, etc.
    - search bar????? would be really cool
